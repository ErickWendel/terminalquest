# TerminalQuest

Answer the call of the cursor, and discover your power to change the world with code.

**TerminalQuest** is role-playing game where you - as an elite agent known as the Operator - embark on an adventure to explore and safeguard the virtual universe of The Cloud. To do so, you will need to master the tools of software development and beyond. Do you have what it takes to defeat the evil Legacy Systems and save The Cloud?

## Playing the game

The game is currently under active development, after a transition in ownership. End-user friendly builds of the game are coming soon!

## Local development

Developing TerminalQuest requires the following dependencies to be installed:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [npm](npmjs.com) - the game is currently tested and running locally with Node 18.
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is currently required to install and configure some dependencies. Python 3.9 should work - 3.11 has been known to cause problems with our current build.

After cloning this repository, install dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

Fair warning - during this transitional period, this process may not happen without error. After dependencies are successfully installed, you can run the game in development mode with:

```
npm start
```

This will open a local [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org) window running the game.
